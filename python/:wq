Steps to make a spider:
1. make headers, url, data  
2. form a request,  request = urllib2.Request(url, data, headers), you will need urllib.urlencode(values) to form the right format of data, with a dictionnary values
3. get response, response = urllib2.urlopen(request)
4. Analyse the response, it's a string of the code of the page(HTML, etc.), you can use bs4 or re to analyse the page

Now python3

With python ver > 2.7.9, urlopen method will verify the ssl certificate uponopen the request, if the target host uses auto-signed certificate, you'll suffer a URLError, to deal with this problem, you'll need:

import ssl
ssl._create_default_https_context = ssl._create_unverified_context
